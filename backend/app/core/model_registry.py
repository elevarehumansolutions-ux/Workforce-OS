"""Central registry for all SQLAlchemy ORM models.

This module imports every model class defined in the application. It is
critical for two reasons:
1.  **Alembic Autogenerate**: Alembic needs all models to be imported into
    its environment to correctly detect schema changes.
2.  **SQLAlchemy Mapper**: Models referencing each other via string-based
    class names (e.g., ``relationship("User", ...)``) require the referenced
    models to be loaded into the registry first.

Import order generally follows dependency hierarchy to avoid resolution
issues during initialization.
